### History

My first tech job was Marketing, at a 20-year company of only 11 people, migrating on-premise regulatory software to cloud SaaS. The team taught me some hello-world JS, and why an adventurer would roll 2d6 rather than 1d12 (for **long-term investments in reliable results**). 

I wrote a good joke about Jenkins. 🌱

I worked **Technical Support** then **Product Management** during scale-up at Zapier (YC AI B2B, growing from 100 to 1,000 people). I read roughly 1 million API docs and wrote 1. I ran postmortems for infrastructure teams and operationalized chat support. 

I led the app’s 1st pricing **migrations**. 🪽

I **PM**’d with teams using AWS–Python–React stacks. I committed a few 1-liners, but mostly **QA**’d our releases. I wrote (slash copy-pasted) a lot of **SQL** queries --- tho more often I built dashboards in data studios and/or scraped together spreadsheets. 

I love to experiment, so I'm skeptical of experiments. 🤔

---

### Miscellaneous 📝

When I write bug reports, I provide detailed **steps to recreate.** 

**To prioritize** bugs, backlogs, roadmaps, etc, I’ll need your help to define the Cost Of Doing Nothing and the Time To Insight.

**To learn**, I love sandboxes, where I can `click first; ask questions later`. I’ll ask ‘false dichotomy’ brainstorm questions --- like _“would we rather deploy every single hour or only once per year?”_ --- often to ask whether it's the right question.

I'll always ask to hear **what you think** is most important, and which questions you need help answering. 💡
