### History

My first tech job was Marketing, at a 20-year-old company with only 9 people, building a suite of on-premise healthcare and regulatory softwares, while migrating to cloud SaaS. The team taught me some hello-world JS, and why an adventurer would `roll 2d6 rather than 1d12` (for **long-term investments in reliable results**). 

I wrote a good joke about Jenkins. 🌱

I worked **Technical Support** then **Product Management** during scale-up at Zapier (YC AI B2B, growing from 100 to 1,000 people). I read roughly 1 million API docs and wrote 1. I ran postmortems for infrastructure teams and operationalized chat support. I led the app’s 1st price-change **migrations**. 💸

I **PM**’d with teams using AWS–Python–React stacks. I committed a few 1-line lines, but mostly **QA**’d our releases. I wrote (slash copy-pasted) a lot of **SQL** queries --- tho more often I built dashboards in data studios and/or scraped together spreadsheets. 

I love to experiment, so I'm skeptical of experiments. 🤔

### Miscellaneous 

When I write bug reports, I provide detailed steps to recreate. 📝

To prioritize bugs, backlogs, roadmaps, etc, I’ll need your help to define: 

- 1, Cost of Doing Nothing 💸;
- 2, Time to Insight 💡; 

**To learn** a new domain/skill, I love sandboxes, where I can `click first, ask questions later`. I’ll ask ‘false dichotomy’ brainstorm questions --- like “would we rather deploy every single hour or only once per year?” --- often to ask whether it's the right question.

I always hope to learn **what you think** is most important, and which questions you need help answering. 🤔
