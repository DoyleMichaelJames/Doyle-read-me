## 2025, Doyle, ReadMe, 

This GitHub ReadMe is intended for **software developers.** You might see also LinkedIn: [https://www.linkedin.com/in/doylemichaeljames/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/doylemichaeljames/)

**Summary:** 10-years experience, in Marketing then Tech Support then **Product Management**. Enjoy QA, SQL, TTRPG. Always eager to learn and happy to help.

My first tech job was Marketing, at a 20-year-old company with only 9 people, building a suite of on-premise healthcare and regulatory softwares, while migrating the existing government customers to cloud SaaS. The team taught me some hello-world JS, and why an adventurer would **roll `2d6` rather than `1d12`** (to ship long-term investments for calculated results). I wrote a good joke about Jenkins.

I worked **Technical Support** then **Product Management** during scale-up at **Zapier** (YC B2B, growing from 100 to 1,000 people). I read roughly 1 million API docs and wrote 1. Without docs (just pattern recognition and trail and error), I learned a bespoke coding language to hackathon a one-screen app -- it could add hyperlinks to Slack channel descriptions. I ran postmortems for infrastructure teams, operationalized runbooks for outages and led the app’s first price-change migrations.

I **PM**’d with teams using AWS–Python–React stacks. I learned to commit a few one-line tweaks, but mostly I **QA**’d pull requests, and regression tested our high-stakes releases. I wrote (slash copy-paste) a lot of **SQL** queries, tho more I often built dashboards in data studios, and/or scraped together spreadsheets where we didn’t have more data pipeline -- I love to measure our work to quantify our impact.

When I write bug reports, I provide detailed steps to recreate. 

**To prioritize** bugs, backlogs, roadmaps, etc, I’ll need your help balancing 3 considerations: 1, Cost of Doing Nothing; 2, Return on Investment; and 3, Speed to Insight. 

**To learn** a new domain/skill, I’ll often ask ‘false dichotomy’ brainstorm questions -- like “would we rather deploy every single hour or only once per year?” -- often to prompt meta-discussion about whether it's the right question.

I always hope to learn what you think is most important, and which questions you need help answering.
