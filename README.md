## History

My first tech job was Marketing, at a 20-year-old company with only 9 people, building a suite of on-premise healthcare and regulatory softwares, while migrating the existing government customers to cloud SaaS. The team taught me some hello-world JS, and why an adventurer would **roll `2d6` rather than `1d12`** (for long-term investments in calculated results). I wrote a good joke about Jenkins.

I worked **Technical Support** then **Product Management** during scale-up at **Zapier** (YC AI B2B, growing from 100 to 1,000 people). I read roughly 1 million API docs and wrote 1. I learned a bespoke coding language to hackathon a 1-screen app (to add hyperlinks to Slack channel descriptions). I ran postmortems for infrastructure teams, operationalized runbooks for outages, and led the app’s first price-change migrations.

I **PM**’d with teams using AWS–Python–React stacks. My teams taught me to commit a few 1-line tweaks, tho mostly I **QA**’d pull requests, and regression tested our high-stakes releases. I wrote (slash copy-pasted) a lot of **SQL** queries, tho more often I built dashboards in data studios, and/or scraped together spreadsheets.

I love to measure our work to quantify our impact. 📝

## Miscellaneous 

When I write bug reports, I provide detailed steps to recreate.

**To prioritize** bugs, backlogs, roadmaps, etc, I’ll need your help balancing 3 considerations: 

- 1, Cost of Doing Nothing 💸;
- 2, Return on Investment 📈;
- 3, Speed to Insight 💡. 

**To learn** a new domain/skill, I love sandboxes, and I’ll often ask ‘false dichotomy’ brainstorm questions --- like “would we rather deploy every single hour or only once per year?” --- often to prompt meta-discussion about whether it's the right question.

I always hope to learn **what you think** is most important, and which questions you need help answering. 🤔
